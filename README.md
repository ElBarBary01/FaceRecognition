# Face Recognition Project

This project aims to demonstrate face recognition using two different approaches:
1. Basic face recognition using scikit-learn.
2. Advanced face recognition using VGG-16.

## Basic Face Recognition (scikit-learn)

The `basic_face_recognition.py` file contains a simple face recognition application using scikit-learn. It demonstrates the basic principles of face recognition using machine learning techniques.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
## Advanced Face Recognition (VGG-16)

The `advanced_face_recognition.py` file contains a more sophisticated face recognition system using the VGG-16 convolutional neural network.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras

### Usage
1. Install the required dependencies using .
2. Download the pre-trained VGG-16 model.
